## Team Seaborn Project on Time Series Analysis.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
Note: Please hamoye download the html version of our jupyter notebook we included in our repo so you can see the visualization images from plotly library that we used. The reaseon for this is because plotly images do not render for long on jupyter notebook and you might not see it once this project gets to you. Due to that reason we created a HTML version of our Jupyter Notebook. Thanks
